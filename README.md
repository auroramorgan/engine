# A game engine #

Might end up something like a game engine, the idea is at least in the long term to be able to render some stuff from EVE using Metal, Vulkan and DirectX 12 from the same source. Very long term I may also support some silly OpenGL, but OpenGL isn't the new hotness so probably not.
